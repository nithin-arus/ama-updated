**Track** **Title:** Game Asset Artist (3D & Environment) – Zero to
Job-Ready

**Why** **Gamers** **Excel** **at** **This** **Career:**

Gamers have an **inherent** **advantage** in this field. You already
understand spatial awareness from navigating 3D environments, you
recognize visual consistency and polished art direction, and you can
critically analyze game environments for design patterns and asset
reuse. Your eye for what "feels right" in a game world is a professional
superpower—most artists need months to develop this instinct.
Additionally, gamers are accustomed to grinding progression systems,
learning new tools through experimentation, and optimizing workflows for
efficiency—all core skills in professional game asset creation.

> These seams define how the 3D model will "unfold" into 2D space.
>
> 2\. Select all faces (A key). Press U and choose "Unwrap." The UV
> editor will show the unfolded layout. Check that no faces are
> overlapping and that stretching is minimal (check the checkerboard
> pattern in the UV editor).
>
> 3\. Open the Shader Editor. Add an Image Texture node. Create a new
> image (1024×1024). Apply it to the model. Render to verify the UV
> layout is working correctly.

**LEVEL** **1** **CAPSTONE** **PROJECT:** **"The** **Ceramic** **Mug**
**Collection"**

**Project** **Title:** "Three Mugs, One Style"

**XP** **Reward:** 350 XP (Total Level 1 XP: 520 XP)

**Scenario:**

You're a junior game asset artist at an indie studio working on a cozy
apartment game. The art director needs a modular set of ceramic mugs for
a kitchen scene. Players should be able to pick up and interact with
these objects. Your job: create three distinct mug variations that feel
like they belong in the same world, each properly textured and optimized
for a real-time game engine.

**Execution** **Checklist:**

> □ **Step** **1:** **Reference** **Gathering** – Collect 3-5
> photographs of real ceramic mugs from different angles. Save them in a
> reference folder. Sketch thumbnail concepts (hand-drawn or digital)
> showing the three mug designs: one simple minimalist white mug, one
> with a subtle pattern, one with a handle variation.
>
> □ **Step** **2:** **Base** **Mesh** **Blocking** – In Blender, create
> a simple cylindrical base mesh for Mug \#1. Using box modeling,
> extrude the top to create the cup interior. Add an edge loop at the
> rim and another at mid-height for definition. Apply a subdivision
> surface modifier (2 levels).
>
> □ **Step** **3:** **Mug** **Handle** **Modeling** – Use a torus or
> extruded curve to create a realistic handle for Mug \#1. Position it
> on the side. Adjust scale to match the cup proportions. Ensure the
> handle has enough geometry at connection points (at least 4 edge
> loops) to deform smoothly.
>
> □ **Step** **4:** **Mug** **Variations** – Duplicate Mug \#1 twice.
> For Mug \#2, adjust the cup height and width. For Mug \#3, keep the
> same base but model a decorative rim detail or change the handle
> thickness. Apply subdivision surfaces to all three.
>
> □ **Step** **5:** **UV** **Unwrapping** **(All** **Three** **Mugs)** –
> Enter Edit Mode for Mug \#1. Select appropriate edge loops for seaming
> (typically one seam down the back, one around the rim, one on the
> handle). Mark seams, unwrap, and ensure minimal stretching. Repeat for
> Mugs \#2 and \#3. Check that each mug's UVs fit comfortably within a
> 1024×1024 texture space without overlaps.
>
> □ **Step** **6:** **Material** **Setup** **–** **Ceramic** **Base** –
> In the Shading workspace, create a "Ceramic_Matte" material with a
> Principled Shader. Set Base Color to a warm off-white (RGB: 0.95,
> 0.93, 0.90). Set Roughness to 0.4. Set IOR to 1.52 (ceramic). Leave
> Metallic at 0. Add a subtle Noise Texture (0.3 scale) mixed with the
> Base Color at low blend strength (0.1) for micro-surface variation.
>
> □ **Step** **7:** **Texture** **Variation** **–** **Mug** **\#2**
> **Pattern** – For Mug \#2, create a simple tiling pattern material. In
> the Shader Editor, add a second Image Texture node. In GIMP or
> Blender's Texture Paint mode, paint a simple geometric pattern (dots,
> stripes, or abstract shapes) on a 1024×1024 canvas. Save as PNG. Load
> this texture into the Image Texture node and blend it with the base
> ceramic material at 30% opacity.
>
> □ **Step** **8:** **Normal** **Map** **Baking** **–** **High-Poly**
> **Details** – Select Mug \#1. Duplicate it (Shift+D) and enter Sculpt
> Mode on the duplicate. Use the Draw brush to add subtle rim wear,
> minor dents, and surface imperfections. Switch back to the original
> low-poly version. Select the high-poly duplicate, then Shift+click the
> low-poly original to select both. In Render Properties \> Bake, set
> Bake Type to "Normals," enable "Selected to Active," and bake. Save
> the normal map.
>
> □ **Step** **9:** **Apply** **Normal** **Map** – In the Shader Editor
> for all three mugs, connect the baked normal map to the Normal input
> of the Principled Shader. This adds fake surface detail without
> increasing polygon count. Verify in rendered view (Shift+Z).
>
> □ **Step** **10:** **Optimize** **Polygon** **Count** – Select each
> mug's base mesh (not subdivided). Check poly count by hovering over
> the model in Object Mode and reading the statistics. Target: 800– 1200
> triangles per mug. If necessary, reduce geometry before subdivision is
> applied or simplify handles.
>
> □ **Step** **11:** **Export** **for** **Game** **Engine** – Select
> each mug and export as FBX. File \> Export \> Collada (.dae) or FBX
> (.fbx). Ensure "Apply Modifiers" is checked so subdivision surfaces
> are baked into the export. Verify the file includes UV data and normal
> maps are referenced.
>
> □ **Step** **12:** **Test** **in** **Unreal** **Engine** **5** –
> Download and launch Unreal Engine 5. Create a new project. Import all
> three FBX files. Create a simple material in UE5 using the normal maps
> and base textures. Verify mugs display correctly, materials are
> applied, and there are no import errors.
>
> □ **Step** **13:** **Scene** **Setup** **for** **Portfolio** – Arrange
> all three mugs on a simple wooden table in Unreal. Add studio lighting
> (key light, fill light). Set up a camera angle that showcases all
> three mugs clearly. Use Marmoset Toolbag 4 (free trial) or Unreal's
> native rendering to capture a high-quality render.
>
> □ **Step** **14:** **Documentation** **&** **Breakdown** – Create a
> text file or document explaining the workflow: model poly count,
> texture resolution, sculpting approach for details, UV optimization
> techniques used. Take screenshots of wireframe, UV layout, and
> material nodes. Compile into a PDF breakdown.
>
> □ **Step** **15:** **Portfolio** **Asset** – Upload the rendered
> image, wireframe screenshots, and documentation to ArtStation. Write a
> project description: "3-mug modular asset set for cozy apartment game.
> Hand-sculpted details baked to normal maps. Optimized for real-time
> rendering. Texture density maintained across all variations."

**LEVEL** **2** **CAPSTONE** **PROJECT:** **"The** **Character**
**Sculpture"**

**Project** **Title:** "From Sculpt to Game-Ready Character Bust"

**XP** **Reward:** 380 XP (Total Level 2 XP: 580 XP)

**Scenario:**

You've been tasked with creating a character bust for a narrative game's
loading screen and in-game dialogue system. The character is a
mysterious merchant from a fantasy world. The art director wants a
sculpted, highly detailed bust with proper topology for potential
rigging (for head turns and expressions in-game). You'll deliver a
game-ready asset suitable for real-time rendering.

**Execution** **Checklist:**

> □ **Step** **1:** **Concept** **&** **Reference** – Gather 10+
> reference images of faces from various angles and ethnicities. Sketch
> or collect concept art for your fantasy merchant character. Define key
> visual traits: age, scars, unique features. Create a mood board in a
> Google Doc or Pinterest board.
>
> □ **Step** **2:** **High-Poly** **Sculpt** **–** **Base** **Head** –
> In Blender Sculpt Mode, create the basic head form using a UV sphere.
> Enable X and Y symmetry. Block out the overall head proportions:
> forehead height, cheekbone width, jawline shape. Use reference images
> in the viewport (Shift+F to load image as background).
>
> □ **Step** **3:** **Facial** **Features** **–** **Eyes** **&**
> **Nose** – Sculpt detailed eye sockets using smaller brush strokes.
> Create defined eye forms inside the sockets. Sculpt the nasal cavity
> and nose ridge with anatomical accuracy. Add eyelid definition. Use
> Grab and Draw brushes to shape the forms; use Smooth brush to blend.
>
> □ **Step** **4:** **Character** **Details** **–** **Scars** **&**
> **Expression** – Add character-specific details: scars, wrinkles,
> blemishes, or battle marks. These should tell a story about the
> character. Use fine brush work. Add subtle expression (slight frown or
> knowing smile). Remesh (R key) as needed to increase geometry density.
>
> □ **Step** **5:** **Ears** **&** **Neck** – Model stylized ears that
> fit the character. Extend the sculpt downward to include the neck and
> upper shoulders (for a proper bust). Ensure anatomically sensible
> transitions between head and neck. The neck should taper
> appropriately.
>
> □ **Step** **6:** **Hair** **or** **Head** **Covering** – Sculpt hair
> or a fantasy headpiece. Model hair as flowing forms (not individual
> strands—that's too high-poly). Alternatively, model a hood, crown, or
> turban. Ensure transitions are smooth and the silhouette reads clearly
> from all angles.
>
> □ **Step** **7:** **Final** **High-Poly** **Refinement** – Review your
> sculpt in multiple viewport angles and under different lighting
> (rotate lighting with middle mouse). Smooth any harsh transitions.
> Check symmetry (mirror half to verify). Increase overall detail pass:
> refine cheek planes, define muscle structure under skin, add subtle
> laugh lines.
>
> □ **Step** **8:** **Retopology** **–** **Create** **Clean**
> **Topology** – Create a new mesh for retopology using PolyQuilt. Draw
> topology following facial anatomy: eye loops, mouth loops, cheekbone
> loops. Maintain quad topology. Target 12,000–15,000 triangles for an
> in-game character bust (higher detail than mug from Level 1). Ensure
> loops around eyes, mouth, and deformable areas have proper edge flow
> for potential future rigging.
>
> □ **Step** **9:** **Close** **&** **Test** **Retopo** – Complete the
> retopo cage by closing all gaps. Verify there are no open edges or
> inverted normals. Briefly test by overlaying the retopo mesh with
> wireframe view to confirm it follows the sculpt contours. Export
> retopo as "Merchant_Head_Lowpoly.fbx."
>
> □ **Step** **10:** **Normal** **Map** **Bake** – Position high-poly
> and low-poly meshes coincidentally. Select high-poly, Shift+click
> low-poly. In Render Properties \> Bake, set to "Normals" and enable
>
> "Selected to Active." Bake at 2048×2048 resolution. Save as
> "Merchant_Head_Normal.png."
>
> □ **Step** **11:** **Ambient** **Occlusion** **(AO)** **Bake** –
> Repeat bake process but change Bake Type to "Combined." Enable
> "Ambient Occlusion" only. Save as "Merchant_Head_AO.png." This map
> adds shadow details in crevices and contact areas, enhancing realism
> without geometry.
>
> □ **Step** **12:** **Skin** **Texture** **Painting** – In Texture
> Paint workspace, paint a base skin tone appropriate to the character's
> ethnicity and age. Consider weathering, sun exposure, scars. Create a
> 2048×2048 base color texture. Add subtle color variations to lips,
> cheeks, and eyelids. Save as "Merchant_Head_BaseColor.png."
>
> □ **Step** **13:** **Roughness** **&** **Metallic** **Maps** – Create
> additional maps for PBR: paint a Roughness map (grayscale) showing
> skin texture, pores, and weathering; lips and scars are typically
> smoother. Paint a Metallic map (if character has piercings or jewelry,
> set those to 1.0; skin is 0.0). Save as "Merchant_Head_Roughness.png"

>
> □ **Step** **14:** **Material** **Setup** **in** **Unreal** **Engine**
> **5** – Import the low-poly head FBX and all texture maps into Unreal
> Engine 5. Create a Master Material using the normal, AO, base color,
> roughness, and metallic maps. Set up parameters for skin subsurface
> scattering. Create a Material Instance for easy adjustments.
>
> □ **Step** **15:** **Scene** **Setup** **&** **Lighting** – Place the
> character bust on a simple pedestal in Unreal. Set up three-point
> studio lighting: key light (main light), fill light (shadows), and
> back light (rim light). Adjust intensity and color temperature for
> flattering facial illumination. Position camera for a classic bust
> portrait angle.
>
> □ **Step** **16:** **Rendering** **&** **Capture** – Render multiple
> angles: front, 3/4 view, and profile. Use Unreal's high-quality render
> settings (ray tracing, 100+ samples). Save renders as PNG files.
> Create a turntable animation (optional) showing the character 360
> degrees.
>
> □ **Step** **17:** **Polygon** **Optimization** – Review the final
> low-poly count. Document: "High-poly sculpt: 2.8M triangles. Low-poly
> retopo: 14,200 triangles. Texture resolution: 2048×2048 (all maps).
> Detail preservation: 97% via normal + AO baking." Calculate
> compression ratio.
>
> □ **Step** **18:** **Wireframe** **&** **Technical** **Breakdown** –
> Capture wireframe screenshots of the low-poly head showing topology
> flow around eyes, mouth, and key deformable areas. Create a technical
> document: UV layout (verify no overlaps, even distribution), polygon
> distribution, sculpting approach, retopo strategy, texture map
> breakdown.
>
> □ **Step** **19:** **Process** **Documentation** **Video** – Record a
> 1-2 minute video walkthrough: show the high-poly sculpt in Blender,
> time-lapse of baking process, final material in Unreal Engine with
> lighting changes, and final render. Upload to YouTube as unlisted (or
> include on your portfolio).
>
> □ **Step** **20:** **ArtStation** **Portfolio** **Entry** – Upload
> renders, wireframe, technical breakdown, and UV layout to ArtStation.
> Write project description: "High-detail character bust for narrative
> game dialogue system. Hand-sculpted in Blender with 2.8M polygon

**LEVEL** **3** **CAPSTONE** **PROJECT:** **"The** **Complete** **Game**
**Environment"**

**Project** **Title:** "The Abandoned Warehouse – Modular Environment"

**XP** **Reward:** 395 XP (Total Level 3 XP: 620 XP)

**Scenario:**

You're working on an indie stealth-puzzle game set in an abandoned 1980s
warehouse. Your art director has provided concept art and wants a
complete playable scene (~500m² warehouse interior). You must create a
modular asset kit and assemble a production-ready environment. The scene
should run at 60 FPS on console platforms (PS5/Xbox Series X) and 45 FPS
on mid-range PC. Budget: 500K polygons total scene, 1-2GB textures.

**Execution** **Checklist:**

> □ **Step** **1:** **Concept** **&** **Reference** – Collect 20+
> warehouse reference photos: industrial architecture, weathered metal,
> concrete, brick, lighting from high windows. Create a mood board
> emphasizing rust, decay, and industrial aesthetic. Sketch a top-down
> floor plan showing layout: main warehouse floor, office area, storage
> room, loading dock.
>
> □ **Step** **2:** **Modular** **Kit** **Design** **Document** – Define
> modular pieces: (1) 4m straight wall, (2) 4m wall with high window,
> (3) 2m × 2m column, (4) 2m ceiling beam, (5) metal catwalks, (6)
> industrial door frame, (7) forklift, (8) wooden pallet variations.
> Document each piece's dimensions, poly count budget (e.g., walls max
> 3000 tris, props max 1000 tris).
>
> □ **Step** **3:** **Base** **Mesh** **Blockout** **in** **UE5** – In
> Unreal Engine 5, create a gray blockout using simple boxes and
> cylinders. Arrange to match floor plan from Step 1. This blockout
> confirms spatial flow, camera sightlines, and player navigation before
> creating detailed assets. Verify dimensions scale correctly.
>
> □ **Step** **4:** **Model** **Modular** **Wall** **Pieces** – In
> Blender, model the 4m straight wall: concrete surfaces with cracks,
> weathered texture, industrial trim. Add subtle sculpted damage. Model
>
> window wall variation. Target: 2500 tris each for straight, 3200 tris
> for window variant. Apply subdivision surfaces and bake.
>
> □ **Step** **5:** **Model** **Support** **Elements** – Model
> cylindrical columns (target 1200 tris). Model ceiling beams (target
> 1500 tris). Model metal catwalk sections (target 1800 tris). Ensure
> all pieces have consistent visual language and texture density.
>
> □ **Step** **6:** **Model** **Props** **&** **Details** – Model
> forklift (target 4000 tris—hero prop). Model pallet variations (3
> unique designs, 400-600 tris each). Model doors, pipes, light fixtures
> (target 300-500 tris each). Model debris: barrels, crates, broken
> machinery.
>
> □ **Step** **7:** **UV** **Unwrapping** **–** **Texture** **Atlas**
> **Strategy** – UV unwrap all architectural pieces to fit on a
> 4096×4096 atlas. Group by material type: concrete walls, metal beams,
> wood. Use proportional scaling to maintain texture density. Target:
> 85% atlas utilization, minimal waste. Verify no overlaps or seams in
> visible areas.
>
> □ **Step** **8:** **High-Poly** **Sculpting** **&** **Baking** – For
> each major piece, create a high-poly duplicate in Sculpt Mode. Add
> weathering: rust streaks on metal, crumbling concrete edges, paint
> chips, dents, corrosion patterns. Remesh 2-3 times to add detail
> density. Bake normal maps (2048×2048) for each unique piece.
>
> □ **Step** **9:** **Base** **Texture** **Creation** – Paint base color
> textures using Blender Texture Paint or GIMP: weathered concrete
> (gray, brown, rust spots), metal (dark gray with orange rust), wood
> (varied brown tones, grain). Create a procedural base using Blender's
> Shader Editor (Noise Texture + ColorRamp) for variation.
>
> □ **Step** **10:** **PBR** **Map** **Creation** – Create Roughness
> maps: concrete is rougher (0.8), metal weathered (0.6), rust very
> rough (0.9). Create Metallic maps: metal pieces 1.0, concrete 0.0,
> rust 0.3. Create optional Ambient Occlusion for contact shadows. Save
> all maps at 2K or 4K resolution as PNG.
>
> □ **Step** **11:** **Export** **&** **Material** **Setup** – Export
> all models as FBX with applied modifiers. Import into Unreal Engine 5.
> Create a Master Material with normal, roughness, metallic, and AO
> maps. Set up Material Instances for variations: weathered concrete,
> fresh concrete, light rust, heavy rust. Apply instances to pieces.
>
> □ **Step** **12:** **Scene** **Assembly** **&** **Modular**
> **Testing** – Assemble complete warehouse environment in Unreal using
> modular pieces. Place walls, columns, catwalks following your
> blockout. Snap all pieces to grid (0.1 unit grid). Verify piece
> connections are seamless—no gaps or overlaps. Test that pieces can be
> rearranged easily (modular validation).
>
> □ **Step** **13:** **Lighting** **Setup** – Add directional light
> simulating warehouse skylights (high angle, soft shadows). Add area
> lights in light fixtures (warm yellow, ~2000K). Add fill lights to
> prevent pitch-black shadows. Bake lighting for performance. Document
> light placement, intensities, and color temperatures.
>
> □ **Step** **14:** **Atmospheric** **Effects** – Add volumetric
> fog/atmosphere to simulate dust and light shafts. Adjust fog density
> and color (slightly greenish industrial tint). Add particle effects:
> dust motes in light rays (subtle, not distracting). These enhance
> immersion without heavy performance cost.
>
> □ **Step** **15:** **Performance** **Profiling** – In Unreal's
> profiling tools, measure: total polygon count (target 500K), drawcalls
> (target \<300), texture memory (target 1.2GB at runtime with LODs).
>
> Identify any performance bottlenecks. Create LODs for hero props if
> needed.
>
> □ **Step** **16:** **Polygon** **Optimization** **Pass** – If
> performance target missed, reduce draw calls: merge nearby static
> meshes, create additional LODs, reduce material complexity.
> Re-profile. Iterate until target achieved: 500K polys, 300 drawcalls,
> 60 FPS on console.
>
> □ **Step** **17:** **Camera** **Setup** **&** **Walkthrough** – Place
> a camera path through the environment showcasing key areas: main
> floor, office section, loading dock, catwalk views. Create a short
> (30-60 sec) flythrough video highlighting the environment's scale and
> detail.
>
> □ **Step** **18:** **Technical** **Documentation** – Create a document
> covering: asset breakdown (wall count: 32, column count: 8, total
> unique meshes: 18), polygon distribution, texture atlas layout,
> lighting setup, performance metrics, modular design principles used,
> optimization techniques applied.
>
> □ **Step** **19:** **Render** **High-Quality** **Showcase** **Images**
> – Render 3-4 hero shots from different camera angles with high ray
> tracing quality (100+ samples), depth of field, and color grading.
> Show off lighting and weathering details. Save at 4K resolution for
> portfolio.
>
> □ **Step** **20:** **ArtStation** **Portfolio** **Entry** **–**
> **Complete** **Project** – Upload all renders, technical breakdown,
> flythrough video, and documentation. Write detailed project
> description: "Production-ready warehouse environment for indie

**LEVEL** **4** **CAPSTONE** **PROJECT:** **"The** **Professional**
**Portfolio** **Piece"**

**Project** **Title:** "Hero Asset: The Cyberpunk Holographic Kiosk"

**XP** **Reward:** 415 XP (Total Level 4 XP: 650 XP)

**Scenario:**

You're pitching for a senior artist role at a mid-size indie studio
working on a cyberpunk adventure game. They've asked you to submit a
"hero asset"—a single standout piece that demonstrates mastery of your
skillset: modeling, sculpting, texturing, optimization, and
presentation. You choose to create a futuristic holographic information
kiosk that would appear in the game's neon-lit city environments. This
is your showstopper piece.

**Execution** **Checklist:**

> □ **Step** **1:** **Concept** **&** **Design** – Research cyberpunk
> aesthetic: geometric forms, neon colors, holographic UI elements,
> weathered futuristic materials. Create concept sketches (5+ angles)
> showing the kiosk design: a sleek rectangular display with holographic
> interface, weathered cyberpunk body, neon accent lighting, modular
> panel design.
>
> □ **Step** **2:** **Color** **&** **Mood** **Board** – Collect
> reference images: cyberpunk architecture, sci-fi interfaces,
> holographic effects, neon lighting. Define color palette: cool blues
> and magentas for holographic glow, dark metallic grays for body,
> accent neon colors. Create mood board in Pinterest or Google Doc.
>
> □ **Step** **3:** **High-Poly** **Sculpting** **–** **Main** **Body**
> – In Blender Sculpt Mode, block out the kiosk's main form: rectangular
> display area, cylindrical support column, weathered metallic panels.
> Add surface detailing: panel seams, cable routing, vents, scratches,
> dents indicating use and age. Remesh as needed for detail.
>
> □ **Step** **4:** **Holographic** **Interface** **Elements** – Model
> the holographic display screen: a slightly curved or flat panel. Add
> geometric holographic interface elements (rings, hexagons, data
> visualization forms). Model separately so it can have a different
> material (glowing holographic).
>
> □ **Step** **5:** **Accent** **Details** **–** **Cable,** **Panels,**
> **Lights** – Add small details: power cable coming from base, modular
> access panels (slightly recessed), indicator lights at top, weathering
> around edges. These details enhance the "lived-in" feel. Keep polygon
> count reasonable; plan for LOD0 ~8000 tris, LOD1 ~4000 tris.
>
> □ **Step** **6:** **High-Poly** **Finalization** – Review the sculpt.
> Ensure surface language is consistent and readable. Enhance
> weathering: corrosion patterns on metal, dirt accumulation in
> crevices, paint scratches exposing primer. Fine-tune silhouette—ensure
> the design reads clearly from distance.
>
> □ **Step** **7:** **Retopology** **–** **Clean** **Topology** – Create
> a retopo mesh using PolyQuilt. Target 7500 triangles for LOD0. Ensure
> topology supports the geometric forms (straight lines for panels,
> smooth loops for cylindrical elements). Verify UV seams are in
> inconspicuous areas.
>
> □ **Step** **8:** **UV** **Unwrapping** **–** **Precision** **Layout**
> – Unwrap the retopo mesh carefully. Group similar materials together
> (all metallic panels, all weathered areas). Maintain consistent texel
> density. Use Smart UV Project as a starting point, then manually
> optimize. Target 90%+ atlas efficiency on a 2048×2048 texture.
>
> □ **Step** **9:** **Normal** **&** **AO** **Map** **Baking** – Bake
> high-poly → low-poly at 2048×2048 resolution. Include normal map
> (captures all surface detail) and ambient occlusion map (adds contact
> shadows). Verify maps preserve detail and no baking artifacts appear.
>
> □ **Step** **10:** **Base** **Texture** **Painting** **–**
> **Weathered** **Metal** – In Texture Paint or GIMP, paint a dark
> metallic gray base color. Add rust streaks (orange/brown). Add
> weathering: dirt accumulation
>
> (darker gray-brown in recesses), paint chips (expose primer
> underneath), scratches and scuffs. Vary surface color to show use.
>
> □ **Step** **11:** **Roughness** **Map** **–** **Surface** **Detail**
> – Create roughness map: metallic panels are 0.5– 0.7 (mid-roughness),
> weathered/rusted areas 0.8–0.9 (rough), any glass or polished elements
> 0.2–0.3 (smooth). This map is critical for realistic appearance.
>
> □ **Step** **12:** **Metallic** **&** **IOR** **Maps** – Create
> metallic map: metallic panels 1.0, weathered/rust 0.3– 0.5, any
> non-metal areas 0.0. Consider adding a thin holographic glass panel
> with metallic texture 0.1 and IOR adjustment to 1.5.
>
> □ **Step** **13:** **Holographic** **Material** **–** **Glow** **&**
> **Color** – Create a separate material for the holographic display:
> emissive cyan/magenta glow (Base Color bright cyan, Emissive set to
> 2.0 or higher to self-illuminate). Add a subtle animated pattern
> (scroll UVs over time in Unreal) for the holographic effect.
>
> □ **Step** **14:** **Material** **Setup** **in** **Unreal** **Engine**
> **5** – Import low-poly kiosk and all texture maps. Create Master
> Material with normal, roughness, metallic maps. Create Material
> Instance for weathered metal. Create separate emissive material for
> holographic display. Adjust parameters: roughness intensity, metallic
> reflection, holographic glow intensity.
>
> □ **Step** **15:** **Scene** **Setup** **–** **Cyberpunk**
> **Environment** – Place the kiosk in a cyberpunk-themed scene: dark
> city street, neon signs in background, wet pavement (reflective). Add
> strong directional light (hard shadows for sci-fi feel) plus accent
> neon lighting (cyan/magenta point lights) that illuminate the kiosk.
>
> □ **Step** **16:** **Lighting** **&** **Post-Processing** – Adjust
> lights for dramatic sci-fi ambiance: cool color temperature overall,
> but warm accent lights. Add chromatic aberration in post-processing
> (slight color fringing for digital look). Add bloom/glow effect on
> emissive holographic panel. Add slight desaturation to environment
> (cyberpunk color grade).
>
> □ **Step** **17:** **Multiple** **Render** **Passes** – Render several
> views: (1) Front hero shot (best angle), (2) 3/4 view showing form,
> (3) Close-up detail shot highlighting weathering, (4) Environmental
> context showing kiosk in cyberpunk street, (5) Beauty pass (without
> post-processing) for clarity. Render at 4K.
>
> □ **Step** **18:** **Wireframe** **&** **Technical** **Analysis** –
> Capture wireframe of low-poly mesh showing topology flow. Create a
> technical breakdown document: polygon count comparison (high-poly 2.1M
> tris → low-poly 7.8K tris = 99.6% reduction), texture resolution,
> baking methodology, material complexity, optimization techniques.
> Calculate performance metrics.
>
> □ **Step** **19:** **Making-Of** **/** **Process** **Documentation** –
> Record a 2-3 minute video showing: high-poly sculpt progression,
> baking process, material setup in Unreal, lighting adjustments, final
> renders. Show viewport + final render side-by-side. Upload as unlisted
> YouTube video.
>
> □ **Step** **20:** **ArtStation** **Hero** **Entry** **–**
> **Comprehensive** **Presentation** – Upload all renders (hero, detail,
> context, wireframe), technical breakdown, UV layout, making-of video,
> and material node screenshots. Write an exceptional project
> description: "Professional-grade cyberpunk kiosk for AAA-quality indie
> game. High-poly sculpt: 2.1M triangles. Production-optimized low-poly:
> 7.8K triangles. Baked normal and AO maps (2048×2048). Hand-painted
> weathering textures with procedural rust detail. Emissive holographic
> material with real-time glow. Performance: 60 FPS on console, 90 FPS
> on high-end PC. Art direction: cyberpunk noir aesthetic. Complete
> studio-ready asset."
>
> □ **Step** **21:** **Portfolio** **Positioning** – Feature this kiosk
> as your hero project. Place it at the top of your ArtStation
> portfolio. Link to job opportunities mentioning "cyberpunk" or "hero
> assets." Consider writing a blog post about the creation process
> (technical challenges, solutions) to demonstrate deeper knowledge.
>
> □ **Step** **22:** **Polish** **&** **Iteration** – Request feedback
> from peers or mentors in game artist communities (Polycount,
> r/3Dmodeling). Iterate: refine materials, adjust lighting, optimize
> further if needed. Update ArtStation with any improvements. Polish is
> what separates portfolio entries from hiring entries.

**LEVEL** **5** **CAPSTONE** **PROJECT:** **"Your** **Signature**
**Asset** **Series"**

**Project** **Title:** "Five Signature Pieces: The Complete Portfolio"

**XP** **Reward:** 445 XP (Total Level 5 XP: 680 XP)

**Scenario:**

You're preparing for job applications and want to demonstrate mastery
across multiple disciplines. You're creating a cohesive "signature
series" of five assets that collectively showcase your range:
hard-surface props, organic characters, modular environments,
optimization expertise, and artistic direction. These five pieces will
form the core of your professional portfolio and are specifically
designed to impress hiring managers at your target studios.

**Execution** **Checklist:**

> □ **Step** **1:** **Strategy** **&** **Series** **Concept** – Define a
> visual through-line for your portfolio. Examples: "Cyberpunk
> Aesthetic" (all pieces share a sci-fi, neon-lit aesthetic),
> "Post-Apocalyptic Ruins" (weathered, nature-reclaimed world), "Fantasy
> Tavern" (medieval, cozy, warm). Choose a concept that excites you and
> allows you to showcase technical range.
>
> □ **Step** **2:** **Asset** **1** **–** **Hard-Surface** **Prop**
> **(Hero** **Quality)** – Create one polished hard-surface prop fitting
> your series theme. This should be your "showstopper"—the piece that
> makes someone stop scrolling. Plan 40–60 hours of work. Target:
> 8,000–12,000 triangles, baked normals, hand-painted weathering. Render
> at 4K with hero lighting. This is your Level 4 Capstone-equivalent
> quality.
>
> □ **Step** **3:** **Asset** **2** **–** **Character** **Bust** **or**
> **Head** – Create a stylized or realistic character fitting your
> theme. Focus on personality and storytelling through design. Quality
> Level: slightly higher than

Level 2 capstone. Demonstrate character sculpting mastery, proper
topology, and professional rigging-ready topology (even if not rigged).
Target: 15,000–20,000 triangles, full PBR texturing.

> □ **Step** **4:** **Asset** **3** **–** **Environment/Scene**
> **Diorama** – Create a small playable scene (1/10th the scale of Level
> 3 capstone): a corner of a tavern, a sci-fi room corner, or a
> marketplace stall. Demonstrate modular thinking, material variety, and
> lighting mastery. Include 5–8 modular pieces and props. Show
> optimization: scene should run at 60 FPS in Unreal.
>
> □ **Step** **5:** **Asset** **4** **–** **Optimization** **Challenge**
> – Take one of your previous assets and create an ultra-optimized
> version. Document the process: original poly count → optimized poly
> count (target 70–80% reduction), original texture footprint →
> compressed, LOD0/LOD1/LOD2 variants. Write a technical breakdown
> explaining every optimization decision. This demonstrates
> industry-level problem-solving.
>
> □ **Step** **6:** **Asset** **5** **–** **Personal** **Passion**
> **Project** – Create one piece that represents your unique artistic
> voice—something beyond typical industry asset. Could be: a highly
> stylized character with exaggerated proportions, a surreal sci-fi
> environment, an anime-inspired prop, or a photorealistic detailed
> close-up. This piece shows personality and differentiation.
>
> □ **Step** **7:** **Unified** **Aesthetic** **&** **Color**
> **Grading** – Ensure all five assets share visual cohesion through
> lighting, color temperature, and post-processing. When displayed
> together, they should feel like they belong in the same world. Create
> a unified color palette. Apply consistent post-process effects
> (chromatic aberration, color grading, bloom levels) across all
> renders.
>
> □ **Step** **8:** **Hero** **Renders** **–** **Professional**
> **Quality** – Render each asset at 4K+ with ray tracing, 100+ samples,
> depth of field, and color grading. Create 3–4 angles per asset: hero
> shot, detail shot, wireframe/technical shot, context shot (in
> environment). Total: ~18 renders minimum. Invest 4–6 hours in render
> optimization and post-processing per asset.
>
> □ **Step** **9:** **Wireframe** **&** **Technical** **Breakdown**
> **for** **Each** – For all five assets, provide wireframe screenshots,
> UV layouts, polygon count comparisons, texture resolution, baking
> process, and key technical decisions. Write 300–500 words explaining
> the creative and technical journey for each piece.
>
> □ **Step** **10:** **Making-Of** **Video** – Create a 5–10 minute
> video showcasing the creation of all five assets: sculpting, baking,
> texturing, lighting, and final renders. Use time-lapse for repetitive
> tasks. Include interview-style commentary: "This asset challenged me
> to... Here's how I solved..." Show both process and results.
>
> □ **Step** **11:** **ArtStation** **Master** **Portfolio** **Setup** –
> Create or significantly upgrade your ArtStation profile. Upload all
> five signature pieces at the top. Write compelling descriptions for
> each. Include tags for searchability. Create a portfolio breakdown
> post: "5-Piece Signature Series: Technique, Tools, and Results."
>
> □ **Step** **12:** **Personal** **Website** **(Optional** **but**
> **Impressive)** – Create a simple personal website (Webflow,
> Squarespace, or custom) showcasing your five pieces with interactive
> 3D viewers (Sketchfab embeds). Add an About page, Resume link, and
> Contact form. A personal site differentiates you from other artists.
>
> □ **Step** **13:** **PDF** **Portfolio** **Document** – Create a
> professional 20–30 page PDF portfolio document: cover page with
> tagline, five double-page spreads (one per asset with renders and
> breakdown), final page with contact info and social links. Format
> professionally with consistent typography and whitespace. This is what
> you send when applying to jobs.
>
> □ **Step** **14:** **Resume** **&** **Cover** **Letter** **Template**
> – Write a one-page resume highlighting these five projects
> prominently. Create a cover letter template you can customize for each
> studio application. Practice explaining each asset in 2–3 sentences
> (elevator pitch).
>
> □ **Step** **15:** **Studio-Specific** **Application** **Strategy** –
> Identify 10 target studios. For each, customize your portfolio link
> and application to highlight the most relevant signature piece. If
> applying to a cyberpunk game, lead with your sci-fi asset. If applying
> to a character-focused studio, feature your character bust.
>
> □ **Step** **16:** **LinkedIn** **Optimization** – Update LinkedIn
> profile with polished headshot, comprehensive About section, and links
> to all five signature pieces on ArtStation. Write 3–5 LinkedIn posts
> about your process, industry insights, or career journey. Aim for
> thought leadership positioning.
>
> □ **Step** **17:** **Community** **Showcase** – Share each of your
> five pieces in relevant communities: Polycount, r/3Dmodeling,
> game-specific Discord servers, industry Slack groups. Write thoughtful
> technical posts asking for feedback. Engage with the community
> authentically.
>
> □ **Step** **18:** **Freelance** **Presence** – Update Upwork/Fiverr
> profiles with your five signature pieces as case studies. Update your
> rate card and services offered based on demonstrated expertise. Write:
> "Recent projects include \[specific examples\], demonstrating
> expertise in optimization, character work, and modular environments."
>
> □ **Step** **19:** **Conference** **&** **Networking** – Register for
> GDC, SIGGRAPH, or regional game dev conferences. Submit your work to
> Art Director tracks if available. Prepare elevator pitches for each of
> your five pieces. Attend portfolio review sessions and gather feedback
> from industry professionals.
>
> □ **Step** **20:** **Job** **Applications** **–** **Batch**
> **Submission** – Apply to your 10 target studios over 1–2 weeks. Send
> custom tailored applications, not generic submissions. Track each
> application (date, contact person, follow-up date). Prepare for
> interviews: practice explaining your technical decisions, optimization
> strategies, and creative choices for each piece.
>
> □ **Step** **21:** **Interview** **Preparation** – Prepare answers to
> common questions: "Walk us through your pipeline for creating a game
> asset." "How do you approach optimization?" "Tell us about a technical
> challenge and how you solved it." "What's your specialization and
> why?" Practice these answers out loud. Record yourself and critique.
>
> □ **Step** **22:** **Portfolio** **Evolution** – Commit to updating
> your portfolio every 6 months with new work. Add a blog or YouTube
> channel documenting your process. This shows continued growth and
> keeps your portfolio fresh. Establish yourself as a thought leader in
> your niche.

**Final** **Advice:** **Your** **Journey** **Ahead**

**This** **5-level** **curriculum** **represents** **~300–400**
**hours** **of** **deliberate** **practice.** That's roughly 3–4 months
of full-time study, or 6–8 months part-time. The investment is
significant, but the payoff—a sustainable career doing work you love,
earning \$50K–\$150K+, and contributing to games that millions play—is
extraordinary.

**Key** **Principles** **to** **Remember:**

> 1\. **Consistency** **over** **intensity.** 2 hours daily beats 16
> hours once a week.
>
> 2\. **Learn** **by** **doing.** Watch tutorials, but spend 70% of your
> time creating, not watching.
>
> 3\. **Seek** **feedback** **ruthlessly.** Post WIPs in communities.
> Critique improves work faster than isolation.
>
> 4\. **Specialize,** **then** **expand.** Master one discipline (e.g.,
> environments) before branching out.
>
> 5\. **Your** **portfolio** **is** **your** **resume.** Every piece
> either strengthens or dilutes your candidacy. Quality \> quantity.
>
> 6\. **The** **industry** **values** **optimization.** Artists who ship
> 10x faster or produce assets with 1/10th the memory footprint are
> worth 10x more than generalists.
>
> 7\. **Networking** **is** **not** **shameless** **self-promotion.**
> Engage authentically. Help others. The industry is smaller than you
> think; reputations matter.

**You** **have** **everything** **you** **need.** Blender is free.
Unreal Engine is free. The best learning resources are free or \$20. The
barrier to entry is not financial—it's discipline and determination. If
you complete this curriculum, you'll be qualified for entry-level
positions at real game studios.
