# Hydration Mismatch Fixes Applied

## Problem Fixed
- Next.js app was flashing between `/` and `/dashboard` due to hydration mismatches
- localStorage checks were running during SSR, causing server/client content differences
- Redirect loops occurred because routing logic ran before client state was properly initialized

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Hooks to be Client-Only

**`src/hooks/useUltravoxState.ts`**
- Added `mounted` state to `useDashboardUnlock()` and `useTrackLock()`
- Only access localStorage after `mounted === true`
- Return `{ unlocked, mounted }` and `{ isLocked, assignedTrack, mounted }`

**`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`**
- Added `mounted` state
- Only initialize Supabase auth after mounting
- Return `mounted` in hook result

### 2. Fixed Pages with Mounting Guards

**`src/app/page.tsx` (Homepage)**
- Show loader until `mounted === true`
- Only redirect to dashboard after `mounted && isDashboardUnlocked`
- Prevents flashing during initial load

**`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**
- Show loader until `mounted === true`
- Only redirect to home after `mounted && !isDashboardUnlocked`
- Load career data only after mounting

**`src/app/career-map/page.tsx`**
- Show loader until `mounted === true`
- Only set selected track after mounting

### 3. Fixed Navigation Component

**`src/components/Navigation.tsx`**
- Use safe defaults for dashboard lock state until mounted
- Show "Loading..." tooltip instead of "Complete onboarding" until mounted
- Prevent navigation state flashing

## Key Pattern Applied

```typescript
// 1. Add mounted state
const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => { setMounted(true); }, []);

// 2. Guard localStorage access
useEffect(() => {
  if (!mounted) return;
  // Safe to access localStorage here
}, [mounted]);

// 3. Show loader until mounted
if (!mounted) {
  return <LoadingSpinner />;
}

// 4. Only redirect after mounting
useEffect(() => {
  if (mounted && shouldRedirect) {
    router.push('/target-page');
  }
}, [mounted, shouldRedirect]);
```

## Benefits
- ✅ No more flashing between pages
- ✅ No hydration mismatch errors
- ✅ No redirect loops
- ✅ Consistent server/client rendering
- ✅ Proper loading states during initialization

## Testing
- Build passes without errors: `pnpm build`
- No TypeScript/linting errors
- Server renders safely without localStorage access
- Client properly initializes after mounting
